The Sella Pass (2218 m) is a high mountain pass between the provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol in Italy.

It connects the Val GherdÃ«ina(Gardena) in South Tyrol and Canazei in the Fascia Valley in Trentino.

With Pordoi Pass, Gardena Pass, and Campolongo Pass, this pass forms a quadrangle around the Sella group. In the winter, ski trails are prepared that make the entire round in both directions, known as the Sella Ronda.
